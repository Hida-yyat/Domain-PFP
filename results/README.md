# Benchmark Results

Here we are providing the results of Domain-PFP on two benchmarks.

## CAFA3

The CAFA3 benchmark can be accessed from [https://biofunctionprediction.org/cafa/](https://biofunctionprediction.org/cafa/).

GO term prediction by Domain-PFP on the CAFA3 dataset is made available at [https://kiharalab.org/domainpfp/cafa3_predictions.zip](https://kiharalab.org/domainpfp/cafa3_predictions.zip)

The predictions of Domain-PFP were evaluated using the official CAFA Assessment Tool [https://github.com/ashleyzhou972/CAFA_assessment_tool](https://github.com/ashleyzhou972/CAFA_assessment_tool).

Our results can be found inside the `/CAFA3` directory.

## PROBE

The CAFA3 benchmark can be accessed from [https://probe.kansil.org](https://probe.kansil.org).

The embeddings of the proteins from the PROBE benchmark dataset, computed by DomainGO-prob are made available at [https://kiharalab.org/domainpfp/probe_embeddings.zip](https://kiharalab.org/domainpfp/probe_embeddings.zip).

The embeddings computed by Domain-PFP were evaluated using the official CodeOcean release of PROBE [https://probe.kansil.org](https://probe.kansil.org).

Our results can be found inside the `/PROBE` directory.
